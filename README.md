## Update for Big Sur

Big sur is missing CoreFoundation, this `rmd.sh` will meet an error like:

```bash
clang: error: no such file or directory: '/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation'
clang: error: no such file or directory: '/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices'
make: *** [../bin/osx/release/RDM.app/Contents/MacOS/RDM] Error 1
```

Thanks to https://github.com/FuckDoctors/rdm-builder, I build a github action to build RDM.app
